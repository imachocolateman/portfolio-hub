## Front End Design ideas
---
Posted notes design. Each posted note opens up to a specific project. Posted notes of different sizes.
Displaying the at times scattered nature of ideas generation

### Bootstrap Edition
Front end based on Bootstrap tutorial on freecodecamp

## Additions
---
- Find Me map?
- Projects Graph? Gant chart to show which project and what dates. Similar to Wikipedia band members
- A Landing/loading screen. Once loaded, redirect to projects page

## To do:
---
- [] Header make logo centre on mobile view
- [] Change bootstrap view for Header 'Latest Project' to only dissapear on xsmall view
- [] Add spacing between cards vertically. Same padding as horizontal
- [] Optimize model and view as to not repeat yourself - i.e def get_context_data: context['latest project'] line is repeated
